Self rating 

This is your first team assignment. Your team needs to complete the product vision for your part of the deliverable. As part of the confirmation of the work, please complete the following rubric. Your ratings should be on a scale of 1-5, where 5 indicating that the criteria have been met to the full satisfaction, and 0 indicating that the criteria have not been addressed in the current sprint. A self-rating of 3 indicates that the criteria are barely met. 

Keep in mind that the expectation is not that all the items below are completed before any scrums. This list will be used to track your progress on your project (product).

Only one submission per team - have your file name indicate the team, and include the names of the team members.

Team members: Ethan Ho, Mina Messad, Allen Chacko Johny, Carlos Vanegas Hinojosa, Sarvani Yoganand Lakshmitulasi
